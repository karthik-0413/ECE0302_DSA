# Data Structure and Algorithms (DSA) Class Projects

This repository contains files and projects from my Data Structure and Algorithms class. The files include implementations of various data structures, algorithms, and related coursework.

# Overview:
- **Implementations**: Linked Lists, Queues, Stakcs, Arrays, Trees, Graphs, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting Algorithms, Searching Algorithms, etc.
- **Assignments**: Programming Problems and Projects from the DSA class.

# Projects:
- **Project 1 - Bitset**: This project involves implementing a `Bitset` class in C++ to represent and manage a set of bits. Unlike the C++ standard library's `bitset` that requires compile-time size, this `Bitset` class allows for runtime size specification. Key features include setting, resetting, toggling, and testing bits, along with managing invalid states. 
- **Project 2 - Palindromes**: This project involves implementing a C++ class `FindPalindrome` to identify sentence palindromes from a list of words. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards, and for sentences, spaces and punctuation are ignored while checking.
- **Project 3 - XML Parser**: This project involves developing a tool to parse and validate XML files based on specified syntax rules. 
- **Project 4 - Pathfinding**: This project involves developing a pathfinding algorithm to solve mazes, an essential task in CAD tools for designing ICs and reconfigurable devices.

# Programming Problems:
- **Program 0**: Install VSCode and fix add function.
- **Program 1**: Write an interface for the generic Bag ADT and adapt our implementation of Bag to derive from this interface.
- **Program 2**: You will have to implement two array-based implementations that conform to the AbstractBag interface.
- **Program 3**: You are to create two ordered list implementations that derive from AbstractList using the provided starter code for problem03.
- **Program 4**: Using the provided starter code for problem04/postpre, implement the function convert() in algebraic_expressions.cpp to convert an expression in postfix notation to prefix notation. 
- **Program 5**: Using the provided starter code for problem05, implement a function sort() in sort.hpp to sort an input list in ascending order and return the sorted list.
- **Program 6**: Implement the Sorted List ADT using a linked list. Each new item inserted into the sorted list should be inserted such that the items are always in ascending order.
- **Program 7**: Complete the priority queue ADT using a sorted list and using composition.
- **Program 8**: Complete the binary search tree insert and remove methods and ensure that it passes the tests in test_bst.cpp
